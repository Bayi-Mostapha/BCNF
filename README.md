# Relational model project
A project made by me and @redaelkhayati to calculate closures of attributes, generate all possible keys of a relation and decompose a relation into BCNF

## Getting Started

To use this program, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code files.
2. Ensure that you have a C compiler installed on your system.
3. Complie and run the code.

## Usage

The program will prompt you to enter the relation's attributes and functional dependencies. The attributes should be entered as a single string, with each attribute separated by commas. For example: A,B,C,D

Next, you need to enter the functional dependencies. Each functional dependency should be entered as two or more attributes sets separated by a right arrow (->). For example:
A,B->C
C->D

The program will then show a menu in the terminal.
